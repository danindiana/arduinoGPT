using: Arduino IDE Linux 1.8.19

This Arduino code dynamically generates a fluctuating sine wave by adjusting its frequency and amplitude based on random factors, and then it outputs the wave's value to the serial port in real time. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Includes and Initialization
- **`#include <Entropy.h>`**: Includes the Entropy library, which is used to generate high-quality random numbers. This is useful for applications requiring random variations, such as simulating natural processes or creating secure communications.
- **`samplingFrequency`**: Defines the rate at which the wave is generated, set to 250 samples per second. This determines how often the loop function runs and a new sample of the sine wave is generated.

### `setup()` Function
- Initializes the serial communication with a baud rate of 115200, allowing data to be sent from the Arduino to a connected computer very quickly.
- Calls `Entropy.Initialize()` to prepare the Entropy library for generating random numbers. This is essential for creating the random factors that will affect the sine wave.

### `loop()` Function
- **Angle Calculation**: Uses a static variable `angle` to keep track of the current angle for the sine wave calculation. The angle is incremented in each loop iteration by `angleIncrement`, which is calculated based on the `samplingFrequency`.
- **Random Factors**:
  - **`randomFrequencyFactor`**: Generates a random number between 100 and 11800, then scales it down by dividing by 1000. This factor is used to randomly adjust the frequency of the sine wave.
  - **`randomAmplitudeFactor`**: Generates a random number between 10 and 4000, then scales it down by dividing by 10. This factor is used to randomly adjust the amplitude of the sine wave.
- **Wave Generation**:
  - Calculates the frequency as a base of 5 Hz plus a variable component influenced by `randomFrequencyFactor`, allowing the frequency to fluctuate.
  - Calculates the amplitude as a base of 50 units multiplied by `randomAmplitudeFactor`, allowing the amplitude to fluctuate.
  - Generates a sine wave value (`y`) using the current `angle` and the dynamically calculated `frequency` and `amplitude`. This results in a sine wave that varies in both frequency and amplitude over time.
- **Serial Output**: Outputs the calculated sine wave value to the serial port, which can be visualized using the Arduino Serial Plotter.
- **Angle Update**: Increments the `angle` by `angleIncrement` to prepare for the next sample generation.
- **Generation Speed Control**: The commented-out `delay(50 / samplingFrequency)` line would normally be used to control the speed at which new samples are generated based on the `samplingFrequency`. However, it's commented out, possibly to allow the loop to run as fast as possible or due to a mistake since the calculation seems incorrect for achieving a delay corresponding to the `samplingFrequency`.

### Note
The `delay` line is commented out and appears to contain a mistake in its calculation (`50 / samplingFrequency` would not result in the correct delay for a `samplingFrequency` of 250 samples per second). To achieve a delay that corresponds to the intended `samplingFrequency`, one would typically use `delay(1000 / samplingFrequency)` to get a delay in milliseconds between each sample. Without the delay, the loop runs as fast as the processor can handle, potentially much faster than the intended 250 samples per second, depending on how long the rest of the loop takes to execute.
