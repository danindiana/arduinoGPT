For the MPU-6050 6-DoF Accel and Gyro Sensor: Generate an arduino program that places the MPU-6050 sensor data into a vector-based lookup table. The table should only save ten seconds worth of sensor data. The MPU-6050 is connected to An arduino Uno over SPI for this example. Suggest a filename upon completion.

Sure, here's a simple example of how you might do this using the Wire library for I2C communication (not SPI, as the MPU-6050 uses I2C). This program will store the last ten seconds of sensor data in a vector. Each element in the vector is a struct that contains the timestamp and the sensor data.

Please note that you may need to adjust the delay to match the actual time it takes to read from the sensor and process the data. This example assumes it takes about 100ms, so it reads data 10 times per second, and stores 100 readings for 10 seconds of data.

You can save this file as MPU6050_Vector_Lookup.ino.

Please note that this is a basic example and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For example, you may need to add error checking and handling code, or adjust the code to match the actual performance and timing of your hardware.

**Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:**

**1. Header Inclusions:**
- `#include <Adafruit_MPU6050.h>`: Necessary for interacting with the MPU6050 sensor.
- `#include <Wire.h>`: Provides communication capabilities for I2C devices like the MPU6050.

**2. Sensor Object Creation:**
- `Adafruit_MPU6050 mpu;`: Creates an instance of the `Adafruit_MPU6050` object, representing the sensor.

**3. Setup Function:**
   - `Serial.begin(115200);`: Initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 115200 for data output.
   - `while (!Serial) { ... }`: Waits for serial communication to start before proceeding.
   - `if (!mpu.begin()) { ... }`: Checks if the MPU6050 sensor initializes successfully. If not, enters an infinite loop to indicate an error.

**4. Loop Function:**
   - `sensors_event_t a, g, temp;`: Declares sensor event structures to hold accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature data.
   - `mpu.getEvent(&a, &g, &temp);`: Reads all available sensor data from the MPU6050 into the respective structures.
   - `Serial.print(a.acceleration.x); ...`: Prints only the accelerometer data (x, y, z) to the serial monitor, separated by commas.
   - `delay(250);`: Pauses the program for 250 milliseconds before repeating the loop.

**Key Points:**

- The code configures serial communication and initializes the MPU6050 sensor.
- It continuously reads sensor data in the loop.
- It selectively prints only accelerometer values to the serial monitor.
- The delay provides a 250-millisecond interval between readings.

**Additional Notes:**

- The `Adafruit_MPU6050` library is needed for this code to work.
- The sensor should be connected to the Arduino board correctly for data acquisition.
- The serial monitor can be used to observe the accelerometer readings.
