For the MPU-6050 6-DoF Accel and Gyro Sensor: Generate an arduino program that places the MPU-6050 sensor data into a vector-based lookup table. The table should only save ten seconds worth of sensor data. The MPU-6050 is connected to An arduino Uno over SPI for this example. Suggest a filename upon completion.

Sure, here's a simple example of how you might do this using the Wire library for I2C communication (not SPI, as the MPU-6050 uses I2C). This program will store the last ten seconds of sensor data in a vector. Each element in the vector is a struct that contains the timestamp and the sensor data.

Please note that you may need to adjust the delay to match the actual time it takes to read from the sensor and process the data. This example assumes it takes about 100ms, so it reads data 10 times per second, and stores 100 readings for 10 seconds of data.

You can save this file as MPU6050_Vector_Lookup.ino.

Please note that this is a basic example and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For example, you may need to add error checking and handling code, or adjust the code to match the actual performance and timing of your hardware.
