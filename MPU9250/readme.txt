For the MPU-9250 Accel and Gyro Sensor: Generate an arduino program that places the MPU-9250 sensor data into a vector-based lookup table. The table should only save ten seconds worth of sensor data. The MPU-9250 is connected to An arduino Uno over SPI for this example. Suggest a filename upon completion.

The MPU-9250 is a 9-axis sensor (3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and 3-axis magnetometer) and it does support SPI communication. Here's an example of how you might create a program to store the last ten seconds of sensor data in a vector. This example uses the SPI library for communication.

Please note that you may need to adjust the delay to match the actual time it takes to read from the sensor and process the data. This example assumes it takes about 100ms, so it reads data 10 times per second, and stores 100 readings for 10 seconds of data.

You can save this file as MPU9250_Vector_Lookup.ino.

Please note that this is a basic example and may need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For example, you may need to add error checking and handling code, or adjust the code to match the actual performance and timing of your hardware. Also, the register addresses and the initialization sequence for the MPU-9250 may vary depending on the specific breakout board and library you are using.
